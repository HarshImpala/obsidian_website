## Wiki summary

Zamioculcas is a genus of flowering plants in the family Araceae, containing the single species Zamioculcas zamiifolia. It is a tropical herbaceous perennial plant, and is native to eastern Africa, including Kenya, KwaZulu-Natal, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, and Zimbabwe. Its common names include Zanzibar gem, ZZ plant, Zuzu plant, aroid palm, eternity plant and emerald palm. It is commonly grown as a houseplant, mainly because it has attractive glossy foliage and is easy to care for. Zamioculcas zamiifolia is winter-hardy in USDA Zones 9 and 10.
Dutch nurseries began wide-scale commercial propagation of the plant around 1996. It was first described in 1829 by Loddiges, who named it Caladium zamiifolium; Heinrich Wilhelm Schott later reassigned it to the genus Zamioculcas, and Adolf Engler renamed it Zamioculcas zamiifolia....
