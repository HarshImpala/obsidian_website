## Wiki summary

Anthurium papillilaminum is a species of plant in the genus Anthurium native to Panama. A. papillilaminum grows terrestrially and has very dark green cordate leaves on short stems. Its native range is very limited, with the species endemic to only the coasts of Colón Province and Darién Province up to 100 meters (330 ft) above sea level. A member of the section Cardiolonchium, it is closely related to other velvet-leaved Anthuriums, though it does not have silver veins on the leaves like Anthurium crystallinum....
